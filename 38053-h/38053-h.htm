<span class="i0">There's a sudden, fierce clang of the knocker, then the sound of a voice in the shaft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrieking words that drum hard on the centres, and the braceman goes suddenly daft;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Set the whistle a-blowing like blazes! Billy, run, give old Mackie a call&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run, you fool! Number Two's gone to pieces, and Fred Baker is caught in the fall!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, hello! there below&mdash;any hope, boys, any chances of saving his life?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Heave away!" says the knocker. "They've started. God be praised, he's no youngsters or wife!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Screams the whistle in fearful entreaty, and the wild echo raves on the spur,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With the fluttering of wings in the wattles, and the vague, frightened murmur of birds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With far cooeys that carry the warning, running feet, inarticulate words.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the black belt of bush come the miners, and they gather by Mack on the brace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of breath, barely clad, and half-wakened, with a question in every face.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum">[14]</span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who's below?" "Where's the fall?" "Didn't I tell you?&mdash;Didn't I say them sets wasn't sound?"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In the dim drive with ardour heroic two facemen are pegging away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long and Coots in the rise heard her thunder, and they fled without word or delay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the drive, and they rushed for the ladders, and they went up the shaft with a run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they knew the weak spot in the workings, and they guessed there was graft to be done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Number Two was pitch dark, and they scrambled to the plat and they made for the face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the roof had come down fifty yards in, and the reef was all over the place.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fresher men from the surface replace them, and they're hauled up on top for a blow;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bare-armed, and bare-chested, and brawny, with a grim, meaning set of the jaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The relay hurries in to the rescue, caring not for the danger a straw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis not toil, but a battle, they're called to, and like Trojans the miners respond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a dead man lies crushed 'neath the timbers, or a live man is choking beyond.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By the faint, yellow glow of the candles, where the dank drive is hot with their breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the verge of the Land of the Shadow, waging war breast to bosom with Death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How they struggle, these giants! and slowly, as the trucks rattle into the gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inch by inch they advance to the conquest of a prison&mdash;or is it a tomb?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the workings re-echo a volley as the timbers are driven in place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a whisper is borne to the toilers: "Boys, his mother is there on the brace!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Like veterans late into action, fierce with longing to hew and to hack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Riordan's shift rushes in to relieve them, and the toil-stricken men stagger back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Stow the stuff, mates, wherever there's stowage! Run the man on the brace till he drops!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's no time to think on this billet! Bark the heels of the trucker who stops!<span class="pagenum">[16]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep the props well in front, and be careful. He's in there, and alive, never fret."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the grey dawn is softening the ridges, and the word has not come to us yet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still the knocker rings out, and the engine shrieks and strains like a creature in pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the cage rushes up to the surface and drops back into darkness again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the capstan a woman is crouching. In her eyes neither hope nor despair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a yearning that glowers like frenzy bids those who'd speak pity forbear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a figure in stone she is seated till the labour of rescue be done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the father was killed in the Ph&oelig;nix, and the son&mdash;Lord of pity! the son?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hello! there on top!" they are calling. "They are through! He is seen in the drive!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"They have got him&mdash;thank Heaven! they've got him, and oh, blessed be God, he's alive!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Man on! heave away!" "Step aside, lads; let his mother be first when he lands."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was silent and strong in her anguish; now she babbles and weeps where she stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stern men, grown gentle, support her at the mouth of the shaft, till at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a rush the cage springs to the landing, and her son's arms encircle her fast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>She has cursed the old mine for its murders, for the victims its drives have ensnared,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Now she cries a great blessing upon it for the one precious life it has spared.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now this is the law of the Overland, that all in the West obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man must cover with travelling sheep a six-mile stage a day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this is the law which the drovers make, right easily understood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They travel their stage where the grass is bad, but they camp where the grass is good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They camp, and they ravage the squatter's grass till never a blade remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they drift away as the white clouds drift on the edge of the saltbush plains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From camp to camp and from run to run they battle it hand to hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a blade of grass and the right to pass on the track of the Overland.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For this is the law of the Great Stock Routes, 'tis written in white and black&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man that goes with a travelling mob must keep to a half-mile track;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the drovers keep to a half-mile track on the runs where the grass is dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they spread their sheep on a well-grassed run till they go with a two-mile spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the squatters hurry the drovers on from dawn till the fall of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the squatters' dogs and the drovers' dogs get mixed in a deadly fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the squatters' men, though they hunt the mob, are willing the peace to keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the drovers learn how to use their hands when they go with the travelling sheep;<span class="pagenum">[18]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this is a tale of a Jackeroo that came from a foreign strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fight that he fought with Saltbush Bill, the King of the Overland.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Saltbush Bill was a drover tough, as ever the country knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had fought his way on the Great Stock Routes from the sea to the Big Barcoo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could tell when he came to a friendly run that gave him a chance to spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he knew where the hungry owners were that hurried his sheep ahead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was drifting down in the Eighty drought with a mob that could scarcely creep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(When the kangaroos by the thousands starve, it is rough on the travelling sheep),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he camped one night at the crossing-place on the edge of the Wilga run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We must manage a feed for them here," he said, "or the half of the mob are done!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he spread them out when they left the camp wherever they liked to go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he grew aware of a Jackeroo with a station-hand in tow,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And they set to work on the straggling sheep, and with many a stockwhip crack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They forced them in where the grass was dead in the space of the half-mile track;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So William prayed that the hand of fate might suddenly strike him blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he'd get some grass for his starving sheep in the teeth of that Jackeroo.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum">[19]</span><span class="i0">So he turned and he cursed the Jackeroo, he cursed him alive or dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the soles of his great unwieldy feet to the crown of his ugly head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With an extra curse on the moke he rode and the cur at his heels that ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the Jackeroo from his horse got down and he went for the drover-man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the station-hand for his picker-up, though the sheep ran loose the while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They battled it out on the saltbush plain in the regular prize-ring style.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, the new chum fought for his honour's sake and the pride of the English race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the drover fought for his daily bread, with a smile on his bearded face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he shifted ground and he sparred for wind and he made it a lengthy mill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from time to time as his scouts came in they whispered to Saltbush Bill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We have spread the sheep with a two-mile spread, and the grass it is something grand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must stick to him, Bill, for another round for the pride of the Overland."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The new chum made it a rushing fight, though never a blow got home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the sun rode high in the cloudless sky and glared on the brick-red loam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the sheep drew in to the shelter-trees and settled them down to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the drover said he would fight no more, and he gave his opponent best.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the new chum rode to the homestead straight and he told them a story grand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the desperate fight that he fought that day with the King of the Overland.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum">[20]</span><span class="i0">And the tale went home to the public schools of the pluck of the English swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the drover fought for his very life, but blood in the end must tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the travelling sheep and the Wilga sheep were boxed on the Old Man Plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a full week's work ere they drafted out and hunted them off again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a week's good grass in their wretched hides, with a curse and a stockwhip crack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hunted them off on the road once more to starve on the half-mile track.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Saltbush Bill, on the Overland, will many a time recite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the best day's work that ever he did was the day that he lost the fight.<br /></span>

<h2 id="THE_CARRYING_OF_THE_BABY"><i>THE CARRYING OF THE BABY.</i></h2>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">By Ethel Turner.</span></p>

<p>Larrie had been carrying it for a long way, and said it was quite time
Dot took her turn.</p>

<p>Dot was arguing the point.</p>

<p>She reminded him of all athletic sports he had taken part in, and of all
the prizes he had won; she asked him what was the use of being
six-foot-two and an impossible number of inches round the chest if he
could not carry a baby.</p>

<p>Larrie gave her an unexpected glance and moved the baby to his other
arm; he was heated and unhappy, there seemed absolutely no end to the
red, red road they were traversing, and Dot, as well as refusing to help
to carry the burden, laughed aggravatingly at him when he said it was
heavy.</p>

<p>"He is exactly twenty-one pounds," she said, "I weighed him on the
kitchen scales yesterday. I should think a man of your size ought to be
able to carry twenty-one pounds without grumbling so."</p>

<p>"But he's on springs, Dot," he said; "just look at him, he's never still
for a minute; you carry him to the beginning of Lee's orchard, and then
I'll take him again."</p>

<p>Dot shook her head.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, Larrie," she said, "but I really can't. You know I
didn't want to bring the child, and when you insisted, I said to myself,
you should carry him every inch of the way, just for your obstinacy."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>

<p>"But you're his mother," objected Larrie.</p>

<p>He was getting seriously angry, his arms ached unutterably, his clothes
were sticking to his back, and twice the baby had poked a little fat
thumb in his eye and made it water.</p>

<p>"But you're its father," Dot said sweetly.</p>

<p>"It's easier for a woman to carry a child than a man"&mdash;poor Larrie was
mopping his hot brow with his disengaged hand&mdash;"everyone says so; don't
be a little sneak, Dot; my arm's getting awfully cramped; here, for
pity's sake take him."</p>

<p>Dot shook her head again.</p>

<p>"Would you have me break my vow, St. Lawrence?" she said.</p>

<p>She looked provokingly cool and unruffled as she walked along by his
side; her gown was white, with transparent puffy sleeves, her hat was
white and very large, she had little white canvas shoes, long white
Su&egrave;de gloves, and she carried a white parasol.</p>

<p>"I'm hanged," said Larrie, and he stopped short in the middle of the
road; "look here, my good woman, are you going to take your baby, or are
you not?"</p>

<p>Dot revolved her sunshade round her little sweet face.</p>

<p>"No, my good man," she said; "I don't propose to carry your baby one
step."</p>

<p>"Then I shall drop it," said Larrie. He held it up in a threatening
position by the back of its crumpled coat, but Dot had gone sailing on.</p>

<p>"Find a soft place," she called, looking back over her shoulder once and
seeing him still standing in the road.</p>

<p>"Little minx," he said under his breath.</p>

<p>Then his mouth squared itself; ordinarily<span class="pagenum">[30]</span> it was a pleasant mouth, much
given to laughter and merry words; but when it took that obstinate look,
one could see capabilities for all manner of things.</p>

<p>He looked carefully around. By the roadside there was a patch of soft,
green grass, and a wattle bush, yellow-crowned, beautiful. He laid the
child down in the shade of it, he looked to see there were no ants or
other insects near; he put on the bootee that was hanging by a string
from the little rosy foot, and he stuck the india-rubber comforter in
its mouth. Then he walked quietly away and caught up to Dot.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said, but she looked a little startled at his empty arms;
she drooped the sunshade over the shoulder nearest to him, and gave a
hasty, surreptitious glance backward. Larrie strode along.</p>

<p>"You look fearfully ugly when you screw up your mouth like that," she
said, looking up at his set side face.</p>

<p>"You're an unnatural mother, Dot, that's what you are," he returned
hotly. "By Jove, if I was a woman, I'd be ashamed to act as you do. You
get worse every day you live. I've kept excusing you to myself, and
saying you would get wiser as you grew older, and instead, you seem more
childish every day."</p>

<p>She looked childish. She was very, very small in stature, very slightly
and delicately built. Her hair was in soft gold-brown curls, as short as
a boy's; her eyes were soft, and wide, and tender, and beautiful as a
child's. When she was happy they were the colour of that blue, deep
violet we call the Czar, and when she grew thoughtful, or sorrowful,
they were like the heart of a great, dark purple pansy.<span class="pagenum">[31]</span> She was not
particularly beautiful, only very fresh, and sweet, and lovable. Larrie
once said she always looked like a baby that has been freshly bathed and
dressed, and puffed with sweet violet powder, and sent out into the
world to refresh tired eyes.</p>

<p>That was one of his courtship sayings, more than a year ago, when she
was barely seventeen. She was eighteen now, and he was telling her she
was an unnatural mother.</p>

<p>"Why, the child wouldn't have had its bib on, only I saw to it," he
said, in a voice that increased in excitement as he dwelt on the
enormity.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Dot, "that was very careless of Peggie; I must really
speak to her about it."</p>

<p>"I shall shake you some day, Dot," Larrie said, "shake you till your
teeth rattle. Sometimes I can hardly keep my hands off you."</p>

<p>His brow was gloomy, his boyish face troubled, vexed.</p>

<p>And Dot laughed. Leaned against the fence skirting the road that seemed
to run to eternity, and laughed outrageously.</p>

<p>Larrie stopped too. His face was very white and square-looking, his dark
eyes held fire. He put his hands on the white, exaggerated shoulders of
her muslin dress and turned her round.</p>

<p>"Go back to the bottom of the hill this instant, and pick up the child
and carry it up here," he said.</p>

<p>"Go and insert your foolish old head in a receptacle for
<i>pommes-de-terre</i>," was Dot's flippant retort.</p>

<p>Larrie's hands pressed harder, his chin grew squarer.</p>

<p>"I'm in earnest, Dot, deadly earnest.<span class="pagenum">[32]</span> I order you to fetch the child,
and I intend you to obey me," he gave her a little shake to enforce the
command. "I am your master, and I intend you to know it from this day."</p>

<p>Dot experienced a vague feeling of surprise at the fire in the eyes that
were nearly always clear, and smiling, and loving, then she twisted
herself away.</p>

<p>"Pooh," she said, "you're only a stupid over-grown, passionate boy,
Larrie. You my master! You're nothing in the world but my husband."</p>

<p>"Are you going?" he said in a tone he had never used before to her. "Say
Yes or No, Dot, instantly."</p>

<p>"No," said Dot, stormily.</p>

<p>Then they both gave a sob of terror, their faces blanched, and they
began to run madly down the hill.</p>

<p>Oh the long, long way they had come, the endless stretch of red, red
road that wound back to the gold-tipped wattles, the velvet grass, and
their baby!</p>

<p>Larrie was a fleet, wonderful runner. In the little cottage where they
lived, manifold silver cups and mugs bore witness to it, and he was
running for life now, but Dot nearly outstripped him.</p>

<p>She flew over the ground, hardly touching it, her arms were
outstretched, her lips moving. They fell down together on their knees by
their baby, just as three furious, hard-driven bullocks thundered by,
filling the air with dust and bellowing.</p>

<p>The baby was blinking happily up at a great fat golden beetle that was
making a lazy way up the wattle. It had lost its "comforter" and was
sucking its thumb thoughtfully. It had kicked off its white knitted
boots, and was curling its pink<span class="pagenum">[33]</span> toes up in the sunshine with great
enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Baby!" Larrie said. The big fellow was trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>"<i>Baby!</i>" said Dot. She gathered it up in her little shaking arms, she
put her poor white face down upon it, and broke into such pitiful tears
and sobs that it wept too. Larrie took them both into his arms, and sat
down on a fallen tree. He soothed them, he called them a thousand
tender, beautiful names; he took off Dot's hat and stroked her little
curls, he kissed his baby again and again; he kissed his wife. When they
were all quite calm and the bullocks ten miles away, they started again.</p>

<p>"I'll carry him," said Larrie.</p>

<p>"Ah no, let me," Dot said.</p>

<p>"Darling, you're too tired&mdash;see, you can hold his hand across my
shoulder."</p>

<p>"No, no, give him to me&mdash;my arms ache without him."</p>

<p>"But the hill&mdash;my big baby!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>must</i> have him&mdash;Larrie, <i>let</i> me&mdash;see, he is so light&mdash;why, he
is nothing to carry."</p>

<h2 id="THE_HIGHLAND_BRIGADE_BURIES_ITS_DEAD"><i>THE HIGHLAND BRIGADE BURIES ITS DEAD.</i></h2>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">By Lieut.-Colonel W. T. Reay.</span></p>

<p class="h3">(<i>By kind permission of the Author.</i>)</p>

<p>How am I to describe the sadly impressive scene at Modder River on the
evening of the 13th of December? The sun has just set, and the period of
twilight has commenced. The great heat of the day has passed, and
although there is not a breath of wind, the air is cool and refreshing.
The whole British camp at Modder River is astir. Not, however, with the
always<span class="pagenum">[46]</span> gay bustle of warlike preparations; not with the laughter and
jest which&mdash;such strange creatures are we&mdash;almost invariably come from
the lips of men who dress for the parade which precedes a plunge into
battle. There is this evening a solemn hush over the camp, and the men
move from their lines in irregular and noiseless parties, for the time
their pipes put out of sight, and their minds charged with serious
thought. To what is given this homage of silence as the soldiers gather,
and mechanically, without word of command or even request of any kind,
leave a roadway from the head-quarters' flag to a point a quarter of a
mile away, where a dark mound of upraised earth breaks the monotonous
flatness of the whitey-green veldt? For these are mere spectators,
deeply interested, it is true, yet still only spectators. What, then, is
afoot? Civilians, hats off, and attention everyone. The Highland Brigade
is about to bury its dead.</p>

<p>Stand here at the head of the lines of spectator soldiers&mdash;here where
that significant mound is; here at the spot selected as a last
resting-place&mdash;and observe. The whole Brigade, some of the regiments
sadly attenuated, is on parade, and has formed funeral procession, under
Colonel Pole-Carew. First come the pipers, and it is seen that they have
for the nonce discarded their service kit, and are in the full dress of
their several clans. "Savage and shrill" is the Byronic description of
the pibroch, which, in the "noon of night," startled the joyous
revellers before Waterloo. Now it is a low, deep wail, yet voluminous
and weirdly euphonious, that comes from the music-makers of the
Highlands, and every heart stands still to listen.<span class="pagenum">[47]</span> Oh, so sad it is!
"The Flowers of the Forest"&mdash;("He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut
down")&mdash;they are&mdash;playing, shall I say? No; rather does the music flow
out from the very souls of the pipers in a succession of strangely
harmonious moans, and soul calls to soul. Yet beneath it all, beneath
the dominant note of heart-bursting sorrow, lurks that other
element&mdash;"the savage and shrill." Yes, indeed; soul calls to soul
through these pipes&mdash;calls for sobs and tears for the brave who have
fallen&mdash;calls for vengeance on the yet unbeaten foe. The Highland
Brigade is burying its dead.</p>

<p>Following the pipers marches a small armed party. It would have been the
firing party, but volleys are not fired over soldiers' graves in time of
war. Then the chaplain, in his robes, preceding the corpse of General
Wauchope (who had fallen at the head of his men), borne on a stretcher.
One of the bearers is of the dead man's kin&mdash;a promising young Highland
officer. Then come the several regiments of the Brigade, the Black Watch
leading. The men march with arms reversed, stately, erect, stern, grim.
They lift their feet high for the regulation step of the slow, funeral
march. But observe that even in their grim sternness these men are
quivering with an emotion which they cannot control&mdash;an emotion which
passes out in magnetic waves from their ranks to those of their comrade
spectators of England and Ireland, and brings tears to the eyes and
choking sobs to the throats of the strong and the brave. "Talk not of
grief till thou hast seen the tears of warlike men!" The Highland
Brigade is burying its dead.</p>

<p>In a separate grave, at the head of a long,<span class="pagenum">[48]</span> shallow trench, the body of
General Wauchope is laid, in sight of and facing the foe. The chaplain
advances, and the solemn service for the dead is recited in a clear and
markedly Scotch voice, while all bow their heads and either listen or
ponder. A grief-stricken kinsman's quivering hand drops earth upon the
body at the words, "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust," and the grave of the
General is quickly filled in. There, beside the trench, already lie the
corpses of fifty officers and men. They had been carried to the burial
place earlier in the day. There, at the end nearer to the General's
grave, the officers are laid. Beside them their comrades of minor rank
in life, all brought to a worldly level by the hand of death, are placed
in the trench. It is an excavation only about three feet deep, but it is
twelve feet wide, and the dead men are put feet to feet in two parallel
rows, twenty-five on each side. They are fully attired, just as they
were brought in from the battlefield, and each is wrapped in his
blanket. The sporan is turned over on to the dead face, and the kilt
thrown back, the rigid limbs showing bare and scarred in the unfilled
trench. The Highland Brigade is burying its dead.</p>

<p>Once more the chaplain steps forward, and a new funeral service is
commenced. Again great, powerful men weep. Some grow faint, some pray,
some curse. "Oh, God! oh, God!" is the cry which comes from bursting
hearts as comrades are recognised, and soil is sprinkled over them by
hard, rough hands, which tremble now as they never trembled in the face
of a foe. Then the burial parties get to work, gently as a sweet woman
tucks the bedclothes round her sleeping child. The soft soil falls
kindly upon the shreds of humanity<span class="pagenum">[49]</span> beneath. Men cease to weep, and
catch something of the "rapture of repose" of which a poet has sung.
Mother Earth has claimed her own, and the brave are sleeping their last
sleep in her kindly embrace. Again the dirge of the pipes, and the sweet
strains of "Lochaber no more" fill the evening air. The Highland Brigade
is burying its dead.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the cable has carried its budget of sad messages to the old
land. There, in a wee cottage by the bonnie burn side, the bereaved
mother bows her aged head and says, "Thy will be done." There also the
heart-broken once wife, newly-made widow, pours out the anguish of her
soul as she clasps her fatherless bairn to her warm bosom. Her man comes
no more. For the Highland Brigade has buried its dead.</p>

<span class="i2">A New Chum in manners and style.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's him, sir&mdash;that's him; he's been here<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A matter of nigh fourteen weeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I know by the rent in arrear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though a gent&mdash;you can tell when he speaks&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came one night about eight, hired the room<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Without board&mdash;it's four shillings, and cheap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I say it, and me and the broom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And good yaller soap for its keep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a widow with nine, which the twins&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bless their 'arts&mdash;are that sturdy and bold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At their tricks soon as daylight begins,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Even now when it's perishing cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O' mornings; and Betsy, my girl,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As answered the door, sir, for you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She's so slow for her age, though a pearl<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When there's any long job to get through;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Bobby&mdash;but there, I forgot;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You'll pardon a mother, I know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, for six weeks he paid up his shot,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then I could see funds was low.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dressed just as neat, but his coat<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Got buttoned up nigher his chin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the scarf twisted round his poor throat<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Missed a friend in the shape of a pin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the rent it run on, for, says I,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He's out of his luck, I can see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wants all his money to buy<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His wittles (you brat, let that be).<span class="pagenum">[52]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he works I can't tell, but he's out<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Every morning at nine from the house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he comes back at six or about,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And ups to his room like a mouse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Sundays the same, so I s'pose<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He visits his friends on that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But where it may be that he goes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It's not in my knowledge to say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ain't well. I can tell by his walk;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He's as thin as a lath, and <i>that</i> pale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I never could get him to talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So I can't rightly guess what may ail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never sends out for no beer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He don't smoke, and as far as I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the few clothes he brought here,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a desk, he's as hard up as me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What! you bring him good news; I <i>am</i> glad!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A fortune! ten thousand! Oh, la!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's the physic for <i>you</i>, my poor lad.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This way, sir; it's not very far.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mind that stair, please&mdash;the banister's broke.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here's his door; hush, I'll knock. Ah! asleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can't help it&mdash;you'd better be woke;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The news is too pretty to keep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ain't he sound, eh? Poor fellow, he's rocked<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To rest in the Kingdom of Nod.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'd better go in. It's not locked.<br /></span>

<h2 id="THE_LITTLE_DUCHESS"><i>THE LITTLE DUCHESS.</i></h2>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">By Ethel Turner.</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The tale is as old as the Eden tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And new as the new-cut tooth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He was the clerk of the cash tramway, and when the rolling balls gave
him a moment's leisure, used to look down from his high perch at the big
shop beneath his feet, and, in his slow, quiet style, study the ways of
the numberless assistants whose life-books thus opened to him so many of
their pages.</p>

<p>Lately there had come to the place a slight, grey-eyed girl, who wore
her black dress with such grace, and held her small head with such
dignity, that he whimsically had named her to himself "The Little
Duchess." He liked to look down and catch a glint of her hair's sunshine
when his brain was dulled with calculating change, and his fingers ached
with shutting cash-balls and dispatching them on their journeys. And he
used to wonder greatly how any customer could hesitate to buy silks and
satins when their lustre and sheen were displayed by her slim little
fingers and the quality descanted on with so persuasive a smile. There
were handsomer girls in the shop, girls with finer figures and better
features; but, to the boy in his mid-air cage, there was none with the
nameless dainty charms that made the little Duchess so lovable.</p>

<p>For, of course, he did love her. In less than two months he had begun to
watch for her cash-ball with a trembling eagerness, to smooth out and
stroke gently the<span class="pagenum">[63]</span> bill her fingers had written, and to wrap it and its
change up again with a careful tenderness that no one else's change and
bill received. He had spoken to her half-a-dozen times in all; twice at
the door on leaving&mdash;weather remarks, to which she had responded
graciously; once or twice about bills that she had come to rectify at
the desk, and once he had had the great good fortune to find and return
a handkerchief she had dropped. Such a pretty, ridiculous atom of muslin
it was, with a fanciful "Nellie" taking up one quarter, and some
delicate scent lending such subtle fascination that it was a real wrench
for the lad to take the handkerchief from his breast-pocket and proffer
it to her.</p>

<p>So great a wrench, indeed, that he profferred his love, too, humbly, but
fervently, and received a very wondering look from the grey eyes, a
badly-concealed smile, a "Thank you" for the handkerchief, and a "No,
thank you" for the love.</p>

<p>He had kissed her, though, and that was some consolation afterwards to
his sore spirit, kissed her right upon the sweet, scarlet lips which had
said "No" so decidedly, and then, bold no longer, had fled the shelter
of the friendly packing-cases, and beaten a retreat to his desk aloft.</p>

<p>That was nearly a fortnight ago; not once since had she spoken to him,
and to-day he was feeling desperate.</p>

<p>It had been a very busy morning, and he had found hardly a second to
raise his eyes from his work. The one time he had looked down she had
been busy with a customer&mdash;a girl prettily dressed and golden-headed
like herself. That had been at about ten o'clock. Before twelve her
cash-box, with the notch upon it that his penknife had made, rolled down
its line,<span class="pagenum">[64]</span> and he opened it as he had opened it twenty times that
morning; but this time it bore his fate. With the bill was a little
twisted note, on which "John Walters, private," was written, and the
boy's very heart leaped at the sight. Down below, customers wearily
waited for change, and anxiously watched for their own particular ball
while the <i>deus ex machina</i> read again and again, with eager eyes:
"Please will you meet me at lunch-time in the Strand? Do, if you can. I
am in trouble. You said you loved me." Then, as he began mechanically to
manipulate the waiting balls, he looked down to the accustomed place of
the little Duchess. She was pale, he saw, and her lips trembled oddly
now and again. There was a frightened look in her grey eyes, and once or
twice he thought he noticed a sparkle as of tears.</p>

<p>At lunch-time he actually tore through the shop and away down to the
appointed place. She was there&mdash;still pale, still nervous and
fluttering.</p>

<p>"Let us go to the Gardens. It's quieter," he said, putting a great
restraint upon himself; then, when at last they were within the gates,
"God bless you for this, Nellie."</p>

<p>"What?" said the girl, with uncertainty, but not looking at the plain,
rugged face that was all aglow with love for her.</p>

<p>"For telling me about the worry&mdash;asking me to come. Oh, God bless you,
Nellie! Now tell me."</p>

<p>She sat down on a seat and began to cry, quietly and miserably, till the
boy was almost beside himself. At last, between the sobs, he learned her
trouble, which was grave indeed. She and her<span class="pagenum">[65]</span> sister had very much
wanted to go to a certain ball, and, more than that, to have new dresses
for it, of soft white Liberty silk, such as she cut off daily for
fortunate customers. But her purse was empty, so, in their emergency,
the sisters had hit upon a plan, questionable, indeed, but not
dishonestly meant. The sister came to the silk counter and purchased
thirty yards of silk, paying 15<i>s.</i> for it instead of &pound;3 15<i>s.</i></p>

<p>"That was on account; I was only taking a little credit, like other
customers," said the little Duchess, with a haughty movement of the
head. "On Saturday I was going to make out a bill for an imaginary
customer, and send the &pound;3 up to the desk to you. Don't imagine I would
really wrong the firm by a halfpenny."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," cried the boy eagerly; "it's all right."</p>

<p>"That's not all." The girl began to cry again, hopelessly, miserably. "I
had no money to get the dresses made, and the next customer paid &pound;2
10<i>s.</i>, and&mdash;and&mdash;I only sent 10<i>s.</i> up to you&mdash;I wanted to make it just
&pound;5 I had borrowed. I thought I might borrow enough, as I was
borrowing&mdash;don't forget, I would rather have died than have stolen the
&pound;5, Mr. Walters."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course, I understand," said the cash clerk, seeing it was
a worse fix than he had imagined, but longing to take her in his arms
and kiss away the tears.</p>

<p>"And then that horrid Mr. Greaves, who signed first in a hurry, asked
for my book and took it for something, and then sent it up to the desk,
and the figures are all confused, and the check-leaf isn't the same as I
sent to you. I hadn't time to make it right, and when the books are
compared to-night it will be noticed, and<span class="pagenum">[66]</span> I shall get into
trouble&mdash;and, oh, I am so miserable!" The little Duchess was sobbing
pitifully.</p>

<p>He kissed her, this time in earnest; on the lips, the cheeks, the hair,
the tear-wet eyes. He only recollected himself when a gardener's form,
and especially his smile, obtruded themselves upon their notice, and
they sat apart looking foolish until the two o'clock bells made them
hurry back to the shop.</p>

<p>"I'll put everything right&mdash;don't you worry," he said; and she smiled
relievedly and went to her counter.</p>

<p>That afternoon he did what all the other years of his life he had deemed
it impossible for him to do. He made a neat alteration in his books so
that the &pound;5 in question would not be missed. To-morrow, he resolved, he
would take &pound;5 of his own and pay it into the account of the firm. The
little Duchess should be his debtor, and run no more risks. But, alas,
for the morrow!</p>

<p>Before he had fairly taken his seat in the morning&mdash;before Nellie had
finished fastening at her neck the violets he had brought her&mdash;some
words were said at his elbow, and he slowly became aware that he&mdash;surely
it was a dream!&mdash;was being arrested for defalcations in his accounts. He
learned that for some time past the firm had been aware of considerable
discrepancies in the books, and had placed a detective-accountant in the
office. Last night, for the first time, the man had discovered, as he
thought, a clue, and had convinced the firm that in Walters he had found
the offender.</p>

<p>The lad was ashen pale, horror stricken, as he realised how these things
must go against him. He could not drag in the<span class="pagenum">[67]</span> name of the little
Duchess&mdash;even if he did, it would not avail him much; he certainly had
altered his books, and to mention the girl's share would only be to have
two of them brought to trial, and perhaps to gaol. The little Duchess in
gaol! That hair catching the prison-yard sunshine! That slender form
clad in the garments of shame! The boy drew a deep breath, gave one very
wistful glance at the silk counter, and then walked straight to the
manager's room, followed by the policeman.</p>

<p>"I took the &pound;5 yesterday, and brought it back to-day. On my oath before
God, sir, I have never misapplied one farthing of my moneys."</p>

<p>His voice trembled in its eagerness, the deep-set eyes gleamed, and the
white lips worked.</p>

<p>"Your purpose, Walters?"</p>

<p>The manager looked hard, disbelieving.</p>

<p>"Direst need. Oh, believe me, sir, I have served you three years
honestly as man can serve&mdash;yesterday I borrowed this money and brought
it back this morning&mdash;don't ruin my whole life for that one act."</p>

<p>"Your pressing need yesterday?"</p>

<p>John drew a deep breath again.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;can't well tell you."</p>

<p>Then the heads of the firm came in, indignant at their misused trust,
and they scorned his story. The defalcations amounted to almost &pound;50 in
all, and he had confessed to &pound;5, which had been found upon him. Of
course, he and no other was the offender, and they must teach their
employ&eacute;s a lesson. So John walked down that long shop by the side of the
official, his head very erect, his face pale, and his knees shaking; all
his life he<span class="pagenum">[68]</span> would remember the glances of pity, curiosity, and disdain
that met him on every side. As he passed the silk counter, the little
Duchess was measuring a great piece of rose-red, sheeny satin, that
gleamed warm and beautiful beneath her hands. She was very white, and in
her eyes was a look of abject horror and entreaty; his eyes reassured
her, and he passed on and out of the door. All his life he would
remember that rose-red satin and its brilliant, glancing lights.</p>

<p>After the trial everyone thought him fortunate to get only two years,
and the little Duchess, who had grown thin and old-looking in the
interval, breathed freely as she read the account in the papers, and saw
that her name was not even mentioned in connection with the matter. He
wrote to her a loving, boyish letter, and told her she must be true to
him till he came out, and that then they would be married and go away
where this could never be heard of.</p>

<p>It was no small thing he had done for her, he knew; and, as he was not
more than human, he expected his reward. And the little Duchess had
cried quietly over the letter, and for several days cut off silk and
satin with a pensive, unhappy look that quite touched her
customers&mdash;those few among them who realised that it was human flesh and
blood at the other side of the yard measure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Twenty months later the little Duchess was at the same counter measuring
silk and satin for the stock-taking, when a note was brought to her in a
writing she remembered too well.</p>

<p>"I got out to-day, Nellie. Come down to the Gardens in the lunch-time."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[69]</span></p>

<p>She hesitated when the time came, but he might come to the shop, and
that would never do. So she put her hat on thoughtfully and set out for
the Gardens.</p>

<p>He was awaiting her on the seat where, nearly two years ago, the
gardener had smiled at them. He stood up as she came slowly towards him,
and for a minute they gazed at each other without speaking.</p>

<p>She was in black, of course, but fresh and dainty-looking, with a bunch
of white chiffon at her throat, little tan shoes on her feet, and her
hair showing golden against the black of her lace hat.</p>

<p>For him, his face had altered and hardened; the once thick, curling hair
was horribly short, his hands were rough and unsightly, his clothes hung
awkwardly upon him, and his linen was doubtful.</p>

<p>"The little Duchess!" he said, dully; then he put out his hand, took her
small gloved one, and looked at it curiously.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am glad you're out," she said, carefully looking away from him.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;we must be married now, Nellie; that's all I've had to think about
all this awful time."</p>

<p>His face flushed a little and his eyes lightened.</p>

<p>"It's good not to see the walls," he added, looking round at the
spring's brave show, then away to the blue sparkle in the bay and the
glancing sails.</p>

<p>"We mustn't talk of that time, though, ever&mdash;eh, Nellie?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, regarding her brown shoes intently.</p>

<p>His eye noted the smooth roundness of her cheek, the delicate pink that
came and went, the turn of the white neck.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to kiss me, Nellie?"<span class="pagenum">[70]</span> he said, slowly; and he drew her
a little strangely and awkwardly to him.</p>

<p>Then she spoke.</p>

<p>"I knew it wouldn't be any use, and you'd never have any money or get a
place after this. We couldn't be married on nothing, and it would only
drag you down to have me, too. I'm not worthy of you."</p>

<p>"Well, little Duchess," he said, softly, as she stopped and faltered; a
slow smile crept over his face, and his deep-set eyes lighted up with
tenderness.</p>

<p>Not worthy, his little Duchess!</p>

<p>Then the crimson rushed into her face, and she flung up her head
defiantly.</p>

<p>"I married the new shop-walker, four months ago!"</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The stumps were pitched at two o'clock, but Lawson's face was grim<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I used to wield the willow once," the Parson softly said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If you have no one for the tail, you might take me instead."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But answered sulkily enough, "All right, sir; I don't care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's no one here is worth his salt with breaking balls to play."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'll try and do my best for you," said quiet Parson Grey.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His best," Bill Lawson said to me, "what's that, I'd like to know?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I can't hit out&mdash;it ain't no use; it saddens me to think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bloke that bowled against us once has taken since to drink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He couldn't get my wicket, and his balls came in that way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I batted through the innings without a run all day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The fun began. By George! to think the way our stumps went down!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our boys was made the laughing-stock for them swell-blokes from town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I kept my end up&mdash;that was all, Lawson was bowled first ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And six of them went strolling back without a run at all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nine wickets down for fourteen runs was all our score that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the last man came in to bat, and that was Parson Grey.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The bowler with the break from leg sent down a hardish ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought to see the parson squirm and hear the wicket fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It didn't happen, for he played a pretty forward stroke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew that moment he could bat, that quiet preaching bloke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when a careless ball came down the boys began to roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He drove it hard along the ground&mdash;we took and run a four.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then it was "over," and of course mine was a maiden one,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Parson played a dashing game, his cuts were clean and fine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I only wish that strokes like them could now and then be mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had a fifty to his name in just an hour's play,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By George," said Lawson, "who'd have thought that he could bat so well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could have gone and drowned myself when Bryant's wicket fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, man, he must have been a bat when he was at his best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm glad that Wilson wasn't here, or any of the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, if our chaps are on the spot, and bowl as well to-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll give them news to carry home how country clubs can play."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our bowling always has been fair; we couldn't well complain;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the ninth man was given out&mdash;an honest "leg before."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a single innings game, and plainly on the play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed the glory would be ours upon that Christmas Day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Last man! The bowling crack came in&mdash;of course he couldn't bat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our hopes were down to freezing-point, twelve runs were to his score,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win the match he only had to hit another four.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He swiped; we groaned to think that we were beaten after all;<br /></span>

<h2 id="A_DESPERATE_ASSAULT"><i>A DESPERATE ASSAULT.</i></h2>

<p>I have more than once had reason to admire the British soldier in
battle, but never was there such good ground for admiration as in
watching him prepare. All the blare and tumult, the death and disaster
of actual conflict have no such tense, dramatic, nerve-trying moments as
when a regiment is making ready for some great enterprise. The fight is
a medley of mixed impressions, jostling each other for a moment's
existence ere passing away, but the getting ready is unforgetable.<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
Everything is clear-cut and within the sum of human emotions&mdash;eternal.
So it was with that last grand charge of the Devons, which swept the
Boers from their fringe of the little plateau and finished the long
seventeen hours' ordeal. The enemy were on one side of the Table, we on
the other. A tropical hailstorm howled across it, and beat heavily in
our faces, as Colonel Park led his men up the sheltered face of the
hill, and halted a moment within five yards of the crest, to make ready.
The men knew exactly what they had to do, and the solemnity of a great
and tragic undertaking was upon and about them. All the world for
them&mdash;the too brief past with its consequences, the fast-flying present,
and the mysterious beyond&mdash;might concentrate in a short desperate dash
across a storm-swept African hilltop. It was the sublimity of life&mdash;the
anticipation of death. The Devons were making ready for it, and how
unready a man might feel at such a moment! The line of brown riflemen
stretched away to the left of us, and it seemed that every trivial
action of every man there had become an epic. One noticed most of all
the constant moistening of the dry lips, and the frequent raising of the
water-bottles for a last hurried mouthful. One man tightened a belt,
another brought his cartridges handier to his right hand, though he was
not to use them. It was something to ease the strain of watching. Every
little thing fixed itself on the mind as a photograph. There was no need
of mental effort to remember. One could not see and forget, and would
not, for his patriotism and his pride of kinship, forget if he could.
Then the low clinking, quivering sound of the steel which died away from
us in a trickle down the<span class="pagenum">[81]</span> ranks as the bayonets were fixed&mdash;and a dry,
harsh, artificial laugh, in strong contrast to the quiet of the
scene&mdash;everything heard easily somehow above the rush and clatter of the
storm, and lost only for an instant in the sudden bursts of thunder. A
bit of quiet tragedy wedged into the turmoil of the great play, and all
unspeakably solemn and awe-inspiring. One must see to understand it. One
may have seen yet can never describe it. The situation was not for
ordinary language; it was Homeric, over-mastering.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Devons, get ready." There was a dry catch in the colonel's
voice as he gave the word&mdash;and the short sentence was punctuated by the
zip-zip of the Mauser bullets, that for a few precious seconds would
still be flying overhead. There was a quick panting of the breath, a
stiffening of the lines of the faces, that with so many of them was but
the prelude to the rigidity of death. It was waiting for them only a few
yards up, and their manhood was being sorely tried. But the Devons
squared their shoulders, gripped their rifles&mdash;bringing them up with the
quick whip of the drill, that was too well ground into them to be
forgotten even then. A prompt dressing by the left, and, as though eager
to get it over, the Devons sprang forward to the word into the double
storm of hail and nickel-plated bullets. The killing suspense was
over&mdash;they were in action at last, one's whole heart went with them, and
just for one moment, as they stood fully exposed upon the plateau, it
seemed to the watchers that there might be disaster. They had slightly
miscalculated the enemy's strongest point, and had to wheel by the left.
As they did so the line faltered for a moment. A shiver,<span class="pagenum">[82]</span> a
pendulum-like swaying seemed to run down it; that was the history-making
moment, when the regiment might either do something that ever afterwards
they would try to forget, or that all their countrymen would be proud to
remember&mdash;the moment in men's lives which, measured by emotion only,
stretch out into centuries. It was the moment of a life, too, for the
commander of men. His chance had come.</p>

<p>"Steady, Devons, steady," came the clear ringing call, and then, with
one great surging rush, that gathered momentum even as it lost in fallen
units, the regiment went on.</p>

<p>Boldly though they had taken and held that hill, prudence came to the
Boer riflemen as these eager bayonets bore down upon them. For a moment
they shot the Devons through and through, and then they ran. At that
moment not a man amongst our common-place, drinking, swearing Tommies
but was exalted, deified&mdash;but so many of them were something less of
interest on earth than even a common soldier. Where the regiment had
gone seventy of its dead and wounded littered the hilltop, but still it
was the moment of victory, not of lamentations. It may sound strange to
say that the prelude to a battle, like the preface to a book, can be
greater than the actual battle or the book. But so it seemed to me.
Others might view it differently, but challenge our impressions as we
may in the light of riper history, we shall never alter them. They are
indelible. Overhaul the plates again and again as we please, it will
always be the same picture.</p>

<h2 id="CAUDLE_HAS_BEEN_MADE_A_MASON"><i>CAUDLE HAS BEEN MADE A MASON.</i></h2>

<p>Now, Mr. Caudle&mdash;Mr. Caudle, I say: oh! you can't be asleep already, I
know. Now, what I mean to say is this: there's no use, none at all, in
our having any disturbance about the matter; but at last my mind's made
up, Mr. Caudle; I shall leave you. Either I know all you've been doing
to-night, or to-morrow morning I shall quit the house. No, no! There's
an end of the marriage state, I think&mdash;and an end of all confidence
between man and wife&mdash;if a husband's to have secrets and keep 'em all to
himself. Pretty secrets they must be, when his own wife<span class="pagenum">[94]</span> can't know 'em.
Not fit for any decent person to know, I'm sure, if that's the case.
Now, Caudle, don't let us quarrel, there's a good soul: tell me, what's
it all about? A pack of nonsense, I daresay; still&mdash;not that I care much
about it&mdash;still, I should like to know. There's a dear. Eh? Oh, don't
tell me there's nothing in it; I know better. I'm not a fool, Mr.
Caudle; I know there's a good deal in it. Now, Caudle, just tell me a
little bit of it. I'm sure I'd tell you anything. You know I would.
Well?</p>

<p>And you're not going to let me know the secret, eh? You mean to
say&mdash;you're not? Now, Caudle, you know it's a hard matter to put me in a
passion&mdash;not that I care about the secret itself; no, I wouldn't give a
button to know it, for it's all nonsense, I'm sure. It isn't the secret
I care about; it's the slight, Mr. Caudle; it's the studied insult that
a man pays to his wife, when he thinks of going through the world
keeping something to himself which he won't let her know. Man and wife
one, indeed! I should like to know how that can be when a man's a
Mason&mdash;when he keeps a secret that sets him and his wife apart? Ha! you
men make the laws, and so you take good care to have all the best of
them to yourselves; otherwise a woman ought to be allowed a divorce when
a man becomes a Mason&mdash;when he's got a sort of corner-cupboard in his
heart, a secret place in his mind, that his poor wife isn't allowed to
rummage.</p>

<p>Was there ever such a man? A man, indeed! A brute!&mdash;yes, Mr. Caudle, an
unfeeling, brutal creature, when you might oblige me, and you won't. I'm
sure I don't object to your being a Mason; not at all, Caudle; I daresay
it's a very good<span class="pagenum">[95]</span> thing; I daresay it is: it's only your making a secret
of it that vexes me. But you'll tell me&mdash;you'll tell your own Margaret?
You won't? You're a wretch, Mr. Caudle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas Jerrold.</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="MRS_CAUDLES_LECTURE"><i>MRS. CAUDLE'S LECTURE.</i></h2>

<p>There, Mr. Caudle, I hope you're in a little better temper than you were
this morning. There, you needn't begin to whistle: people don't come to
bed to whistle. But it's like you; I can't speak, that you don't try to
insult me. Once, I used to say you were the best creature living: now,
you get quite a fiend. Do let you rest? No, I won't let you rest. It's
the only time I have to talk to you, and you shall hear me. I'm put upon
all day long: it's very hard if I can't speak a word at night; and it
isn't often I open my mouth, goodness knows!</p>

<p>Because once in your lifetime your shirt wanted a button, you must
almost swear the roof off the house. You didn't swear? Ha, Mr. Caudle!
you don't know what you do when you're in a passion. You were not in a
passion, wer'n't you? Well, then I don't know what a passion is; and I
think I ought by this time. I've lived long enough with you, Mr. Caudle,
to know that.</p>

<p>It's a pity you hav'n't something worse to complain of than a button off
your shirt. If you'd some wives, you would, I know. I'm sure I'm never
without a needle-and-thread in my hand; what with you and<span class="pagenum">[96]</span> the children,
I'm made a perfect slave of. And what's my thanks? Why, if once in your
life a button's off your shirt&mdash;what do you say "ah" at? I say once, Mr.
Caudle; or twice or three times, at most. I'm sure, Caudle, no man's
buttons in the world are better looked after than yours. I only wish I'd
kept the shirts you had when you were first married! I should like to
know where were your buttons then?</p>

<p>Yes, it is worth talking of! But that's how you always try to put me
down. You fly into a rage, and then, if I only try to speak, you won't
hear me. That's how you men always will have all the talk to yourselves:
a poor woman isn't allowed to get a word in. A nice notion you have of a
wife, to suppose she's nothing to think of but her husband's buttons. A
pretty notion, indeed, you have of marriage. Ha! if poor women only knew
what they had to go through! What with buttons&mdash;and one thing and
another! They'd never tie themselves up to the best man in the world,
I'm sure. What would they do, Mr. Caudle?&mdash;Why, do much better without
you, I'm certain.</p>

<p>And it's my belief, after all, that the button wasn't off the shirt;
it's my belief that you pulled it off, that you might have something to
talk about. Oh, you're aggravating enough, when you like, for anything.
All I know is, it's very odd that the button should be off the shirt;
for I'm sure no woman's a greater slave to her husband's buttons than I
am. I only say it's very odd.</p>

<p>However, there's one comfort; it can't last long. I'm worn to death with
your temper, and sha'n't trouble you a great while. Ha, you may laugh!
And I daresay<span class="pagenum">[97]</span> you would laugh! I've no doubt of it! That's your love;
that's your feeling! I know that I'm sinking every day, though I say
nothing about it. And when I'm gone, we shall see how your second wife
will look after your buttons! You'll find out the difference, then. Yes,
Caudle, you'll think of me, then; for then, I hope, you'll never have a
blessed button to your back.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_UNCLE_MOSE_COUNTED_THE_EGGS"><i>HOW UNCLE MOSE COUNTED THE EGGS.</i></h2>

<p>Old Mose, who sells eggs and chickens on the streets of Austin for a
living, is as honest an old negro as ever lived; but he has got the
habit of chatting familiarly with his customers, hence he frequently
makes mistakes in counting out the eggs they buy. He carries his wares
around in a small cart drawn by a diminutive donkey. He stopped in front
of the residence of Mrs. Samuel Burton. The old lady came out to the
gate to make the purchases.</p>

<p>"Have you got any eggs this morning, Uncle Mose?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed I has. Jes got in ten dozen from de kentry."</p>

<p>"Are they fresh?"</p>

<p>"I gua'ntee 'em. I knows dey am fresh jess de same as ef I had laid 'em
myse'f."</p>

<p>"I'll take nine dozen. You can count them in this basket."</p>

<p>"All right, mum." He counts: "One, two, free, foah, five, six, seben,
eight, nine, ten. You kin rely on dem bein' fresh. How's your son comin'
on at de school? He mus' be mos' grown."</p><p><span class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Mose, he is a clerk in a bank at Galveston."</p>

<p>"Why, how ole am de boy?"</p>

<p>"He is eighteen."</p>

<p>"You don't tole me so. Eighteen and gettin' a salary already! eighteen
(counting), nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-free,
twenty-foah, twenty-five, and how's yore gal comin' on? She was mos'
growed up de las' time I seed her."</p>

<p>"She is married and living in Dallas."</p>

<p>"Wal, I declar. How de time scoots away! An' yo' say she has childruns?
Why, how ole am de gal? She mus' be about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thirty-three."</p>

<p>"Am dat so? (counting) firty-free, firty-foah, firty-five, firty-six,
firty-seben, firty-eight, firty-nine, forty, forty-one, forty-two,
forty-free. Hit am so singular dat you has sich old childruns. I can't
believe you has grand-childruns. You don't look more den forty yeahs old
youself."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, old man, I see you want to flatter me. When a person gets to
be fifty-three years old&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fifty-free? I jess dun gwinter b'lieve hit, fifty-free, fifty-foah,
fifty-five, fifty-six&mdash;I want you to pay tenshun when I counts de eggs,
so dar'll be no mistake&mdash;fifty-nine, sixty, sixty-one, sixty-two,
sixty-free, sixty-foah&mdash;whew! Dat am a warm day. Dis am de time of yeah
when I feels I'se gettin' ole myse'f. I ain't long for dis worl. You
comes from an ole family. When your fodder died he was sebenty years
ole."</p>

<p>"Seventy-two, Uncle Mose."</p>

<p>"Dat's ole, suah. Sebenty-two, sebenty-free, sebenty-foah, sebenty-five,
sebenty-six,<span class="pagenum">[101]</span> sebenty-seven, sebenty-eight, sebenty-nine&mdash;and your
mudder? she was one ob de noblest lookin' ladies I ebber see. You
reminds me ob her so much. She libbed to mos' a hundred. I bleeves she
was done past a centurion when she died."</p>

<p>"No, Uncle Mose, she was only ninety-six when she died."</p>

<p>"Den she wasn't no chicken when she died. I know dat&mdash;ninety-six,
ninety-seben, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred, one, two, free,
foah, five, six, seben, eight&mdash;dar 108 nice fresh eggs&mdash;jess nine dozen,
and heah am one moah egg in case I has discounted myse'f."</p>

<p>Old Mose went on his way rejoicing. A few days afterward Mrs. Burton
said to her husband, "I am afraid we will have to discharge Matilda. I
am satisfied she steals the milk and eggs. I am positive about the eggs,
for I bought them day before yesterday, and now about half of them are
gone. I stood right there and heard Old Mose count them myself, and
there were nine dozen."</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
